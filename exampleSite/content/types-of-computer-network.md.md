A **Computer Network** is made of multiple computers connected together to communicate with each other and share data resources.

**Networks** vary in types and size. A home computer network may have two or more computers that share files and a printer, while the **Internet** is a network that spans the entire globe and has millions of users.

There are **three** types of Networks:-

1.**Local Area Network** (LAN) :- LAN is a local network covering a small geographic area such as a Homebuilding or Office. LANs are mostly based on Wi-Fi and **Ethernet** technology.  The Local Area Network is used in your Schools, Banks, laboratories, and University campuses. It is less costly as it is built with inexpensive hardware such as hubs, network adapters, and ethernet cables.

2.**Metropolitan Area Network** (MAN ) :- MAN is a local metro network that connects two or more Geographical Area Network within a Town, City, or Metropolitan area. The network of ATMs in your city or the Networked offices of an organization in a city are examples of the Metropolitan Area Network. It has a higher range than Local Area Network(LAN). ![local-area-network.png](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/metropolitan-area-network.png)
3.**Wide Area Network** (WAN) :- WAN covers a large Geographical Area across Countries or even Continents and users transmission facilities provided by **Telephone Companies** and ISP (_Internet Service Provider_). Banks and E-Banking Networked Offices of Multinational Companies and the Internet are examples of WAN. ![local-area-network.png](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/wide-area-network.png)
